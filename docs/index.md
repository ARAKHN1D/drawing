# Drawing

## A simple drawing application for Linux.

This application is a basic image editor, similar to Microsoft Paint™, but aiming at the GNOME desktop.

PNG, JPEG and BMP files are supported.

More traditional design layouts are available too, as well as an [elementaryOS layout](../data/screenshots/elementary.png). It should also be compatible with [Purism's Librem 5 phone](../data/screenshots/librem_preview.png).
