  <title>Preferences</title>

  <p>The preferences dialog is splitted into 3 parts.</p>

  <section id="image">
    <title>Image</title>

    <p>You can choose the size and color of the default canvas used when
    creating a new file.</p>

    <p>When a file is saved to the JPEG or the BMP file format, the transparency
    can't be kept. The application can replace the transparent pixels with
    something else: it can be white, black, or a checkboard of greys.</p>
    <p>The option "default color" corresponds to the initial color of the
    canvas, which is usually the "default color" setting available in the
    previous section.</p>
    <p>If the replacement you want depends on the image, it's also possible to
    open a dialog every time you save an image to one of these file formats: the
    choices available in that dialog will also be white, black, or a checkboard
    of greys.</p>

    <media type="image" mime="image/png" width="80%" its:translate="no"
           src="figures/screenshot_prefs_images.png" />

    <p>You can also set how you want to zoom on the image: explanations about
    this setting can be found in <link xref="zoom_preview#configuration">this
    page about zooming</link>.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="tools">
    <title><link xref="tools_classic">Tools</link></title>
    <p>You can set whether you prefer normal icons (16 pixels) or large icons
    (24 pixels).</p>
    <p>Choosing whether or not you want to display the names of the tools next
    to their icons is possible here, and it's also available from the
    <link xref="main_features#main-menu">primary menu</link> of the window.</p>

    <p>A few additional tools are also available. If they're not activated by
    default, it's because they might be less reliable or useful.</p>

    <media type="image" mime="image/png" width="80%" its:translate="no"
           src="figures/screenshot_prefs_tools.png" />
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Window</title>

    <p>Here you can set the size of the thumbnail preview, but using a bigger
    preview is not recommended for technical reasons.</p>

    <p>You can also set the color of the background "behind" the canvas.</p>

    <p>Finally, it's possible to choose the layout of the user interface: the
    "Compact" layout, designed for the GNOME desktop, is well tested. Other
    options include the "elementary OS" layout, designed for the elementary OS
    desktop, and the traditional layout, for MATE or Cinnamon desktop.</p>

    <p>In this context,"symbolic icons" means that the icons are monochrome
    (black if you use a light theme, or white if you use a dark theme).
    Otherwise they can be colorful (depending on your theme).</p>
