  <title>Classic tools</title>

  <p>Draw on the image with the color and options you selected!</p>

  <section>
    <title>Color and size</title>

    <p>The options for the tool you're using are located at the right of the
    bottom bar: there are two colors, the tool size, and a menu (whose content
    changes depending on the tool).</p>
    <p>The color of the left button corresponds to the left click, and is
    labeled "Main color", while the color at the right is the "Secondary color".
    Click on these buttons to change their respective colors:</p>

    <table rules="colgroups">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <media type="image" mime="image/png" width="100%" its:translate="no" />
                 <!-- src="figures/screenshot_prefs_tools.png" /> TODO -->
        </td>
        <td>
          <media type="image" mime="image/png" width="100%" its:translate="no" />
                 <!-- src="figures/screenshot_prefs_tools.png" /> TODO -->
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>At the top of the palette, you can select the way the color will be
    applied to the image:</p>
    <list>
      <item>
        <p>Normal: the selected color is added over the existing image. If your
        color is semi-transparent yellow and your image is opaque blue, the
        resulting pixels would be opaque green.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Source color: the selected color replaces the pixels where it's
        applied. If your color is semi-transparent yellow, the resulting pixels
        would be semi-transparent yellow.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Difference: ...</p>
        <!-- TODO -->
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Blur: blurs the hovered pixels regardless of the selected color.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Erase: deletes any color where the tool is applied.</p>
      </item>
    </list>
    <p>If the exact color you want isn't listed in the palette, click the
    <gui style="button">+</gui> button to use the color editor.</p>
    <p>An optional <gui style="button">Color Picker</gui> tool can also help you
    to select a color. While the color picker from within the color editor can
    select a RGB color anywhere on the screen, the <gui style="menuitem">Color
    Picker</gui> tool support translucent colors but only works for pixels from
    the image.</p>

    <p>With the <gui style="menuitem">Text</gui> tool, you can insert text on

    <p>For better contrast, the text can be displayed on a rectangle background,
    or with a shadow, or with an outline. The color of this background is the
    secondary color you chose.</p>
