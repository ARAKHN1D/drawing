    <p>The options for the tool you're using are located at the right of the
    bottom bar: there are two colors, the tool size, and a menu (whose content
    changes depending on the tool).</p>
    <p>The color of the left button corresponds to the left click, and is
    labeled "Main color", while the color at the right is the "Secondary color".
    Clicking on these buttons to change their respective colors.</p>
    <!-- TODO illustrations: the color palette and the color editor -->
    <p>At the top of the palette, you can select the way the color will be
    applied to the image:</p>
